							<h1>Jenny Calahan</h1>
							<p>I am an Origins of Life Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics. 
							   I primarily use thermo-chemical models to better understand the chemical and physical environment within protoplanetary disks. 
							   My models are all constrained by observations, mainly ALMA and JWST. I am generally interested in 'typical' planet formation, including tracing the water reservoir,
						           seeing how clustered environments impact the chemistry of planet formation, and observations of FUOr which expose the volatile chemical reservoir.

									<h2>Thermo-chemical Models for Specific Disks</h2>
									<p>I created very well constrained models for the disks TW Hya and HD 163296 using a 2D-thermochemical model, 
										and reproducing multiple resolved ALMA observations. These produce well constrained 2D temperature profiles of each disk, 
										allow for estimates of disk mass, and are used to futher understand the chemical environment in these disks.  </p>

									<p> Using my thermo-chemical models of TW Hya and HD 163296, I am also able to reproduce observations of the carbon-rich species CH3CN
									, HCN, and HC3N. I argue the only way to reproduce this and all other previous observations are by evoking a UV-enriched radiation field

									<h2>Probing the Water Resevior in the Terrestrial Planet-Forming Region</h2>
									<p> Water is unique amongst molecule for many reasons, including the way it impacts the transfer of UV photons. 
									Once water is optically thick it will block UV photons across a wide range of wavelengths. We implemented this water self-shielding
									in the thermo-chemical code DALI, and I found that it enhanced the H2-18O abundance relative to H2-16O. I was then able to identify the best
									transitions for discovering H2-18O in JWST spectra. </p>

									<h2>NOEMA Chemical Survey of FU Ori Objects</h2>
									<p>FUOr objects are young stellar objects that undergo extreme outbursts due to a rapid increase in accretion from the disk onto the star. 
									This offers a 'hack' to probe the chemistry of planet formation in the gas-phase, as many volitles will sublimate from the ice-phase into the gas.
									I observed 5 outbursting sources with NOEMA and find that each of the disks/inner envelope contain high masses, and I detected COMs, water, and multiple
									sulfur-bearing species in the source V1057 Cyg.</p>

							<h2>Outreach & DEI Activities</h2>
							<p> I am enthusiastic about sharing my passion for astronomy, and take time to inspire future generations to persue a career in STEM. 
							I also know the only way to keep people in this field is to make astronomy accessible to all, regardless of background, resources, and opportunity. 
							Thus, I spend a significant amount of my time in fostering community, with a focus on promoting Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility.</p>
							
						       </p>Below I list Outreach and DEI activites I am currently active in as a Postdoc. Activites from graduate school can be found in my CV</p>
